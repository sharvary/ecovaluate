# EcoValuate Pro - ESG-Integrated DCF Valuation Model

A sophisticated Streamlit application that combines Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics with traditional financial analysis to create an integrated DCF valuation model, demonstrating how sustainability initiatives translate into measurable shareholder value.

## üå± Overview

EcoValuate Pro bridges the gap between ESG performance and financial valuation by applying research-based coefficients that quantify how environmental and social improvements directly impact financial margins and, ultimately, enterprise value.

### Key Features
- **Research-Backed ESG Integration**: Uses empirically-derived coefficients linking ESG improvements to financial performance
- **Progressive Implementation Modeling**: ESG benefits are realized gradually over a 5-year projection period
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time charts showing margin improvements, valuation comparisons, and value creation breakdowns
- **Professional Financial Analysis**: Complete DCF model with terminal value calculation and equity valuation

## üìä Input Parameters

### Financial Inputs
- **Revenue**: Total company revenue ($M)
- **COGS**: Cost of Goods Sold (calculated as % of revenue after ESG adjustments)
- **Operating Expenses**: SG&A, R&D, and Other OpEx (% of revenue)
- **Capital Structure**: CapEx, Depreciation, Net Working Capital (% of revenue)
- **WACC Components**: Cost of Equity, Cost of Debt, Tax Rate, Capital Structure ratios
- **Valuation Inputs**: Net Debt, Shares Outstanding

### ESG Metrics (Current vs. Target Year 5)
- **Environmental**: GHG Emissions (MtCO2e), Water Use per Vehicle (m¬≥)
- **Social**: Female Employee Percentage (%)
- **Governance**: Sustainable Waste Ratio (%)

## üî¨ Research-Based ESG Coefficients

Our model applies the following empirically-derived coefficients from sustainability research:

| ESG Factor | Impact | Coefficient | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **GHG Emissions** | Gross Margin | **-6.15%** per MtCO2e reduction | Resource efficiency savings from carbon reduction |
| **Water Efficiency** | Gross Margin | **-3.09%** per m¬≥ reduction | Operational cost savings from water optimization |
| **Workforce Diversity** | EBIT Margin | **+1.43%** per % female employee increase | Productivity gains from diverse workforce |
| **Waste Management** | EBIT Margin | **-0.11%** per % sustainable ratio increase | Efficiency improvements from waste optimization |

*Note: Negative coefficients for environmental factors represent cost reductions (margin improvements) from resource efficiency gains.*

## üìà Visualization Components

### 1. ESG-Driven Margin Analysis
**Calculation**: Compares baseline margins vs. ESG-enhanced margins over 5 years
- **Baseline Scenario**: DCF projection with no ESG improvements
- **ESG Scenario**: Progressive margin improvements using research coefficients
- **Formula**: `Adjusted Margin = Base Margin + (ESG Coefficient √ó Improvement √ó Progress Factor)`
- **Impact**: Shows how sustainability initiatives directly improve operational efficiency

### 2. Scenario Comparison Dashboard
**Calculation**: Side-by-side comparison of key valuation metrics
- **Enterprise Value**: Sum of discounted FCF + Present Value of Terminal Value
- **Equity Value**: Enterprise Value - Net Debt
- **Price per Share**: Equity Value √∑ Shares Outstanding
- **Methodology**: Identical DCF models with and without ESG adjustments
- **Impact**: Quantifies total value creation from ESG integration ($M and %)

### 3. ESG Value Creation Waterfall
**Calculation**: Individual contribution of each ESG factor to total value uplift
- **Proportional Allocation**: Based on each factor's relative coefficient impact
- **Formula**: `Factor Impact = Total Uplift √ó (|Coefficient √ó Improvement| / Total Coefficient Impact)`
- **Components**: GHG reduction, water efficiency, workforce diversity, waste management
- **Impact**: Shows which ESG initiatives drive the most financial value

### 4. Free Cash Flow Projection
**Calculation**: Traditional DCF with ESG-adjusted margins
- **FCF Formula**: EBIAT + Depreciation - CapEx - ŒîNWC
- **ESG Integration**: Applied progressively over 5-year period
- **Terminal Value**: Gordon Growth Model with conservative terminal growth rate
- **Impact**: Demonstrates sustainable cash flow generation from ESG improvements

## üéØ Business Impact & Use Cases

### Investment Decision Support
- **ROSI Framework**: Quantifies Return on Sustainability Investment
- **Value Driver Analysis**: Identifies which ESG initiatives create most value
